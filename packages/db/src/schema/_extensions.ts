// Required Postgres extensions. Drizzle does not auto-emit these — we run them
// once via a hand-written migration in ./drizzle/0000_extensions.sql (created
// the first time you run `pnpm --filter @kestrel/db migrate:gen`).
//
// Required:
//   - pgvector  (news embeddings)
//   - pgcrypto  (gen_random_uuid on Supabase)
//
// Phase 7 §35 — The REQUIRED_EXTENSIONS constant was never imported anywhere.
// Converted to a documentation-only comment. The actual extension installation
// is handled by scripts/install-extensions.mjs and the 0000 migration.
