# 09a — Deployed State (snapshot)

> Snapshot of what's actually live. If you (or another AI agent) want to
> know "what's already configured?", read this. The original deployment
> plan is in `09-deployment.md`; per-phase progress is in `10-roadmap.md`.

## Phase status

- ✅ **Phase 0** — scaffold + auth + DB
- ✅ **Phase 1a** — live data + chart (PR #4)
- ✅ **Phase 1b** — chat agent + 7 tools + persistence + budget guardrail (PR #5)
- ✅ **Phase 1c** — news + calendar ingestion + embeddings (PR #6)
- ✅ **Phase 1d** — alerts evaluator + email + journal CRUD (PR #7)
- ✅ **Phase 1e** — usage analytics + loading + error boundaries (PR #8)
- ⏳ **Phase 2** — SMC indicators, Telegram, briefings, RAG, composite tools

Pending real-world acceptance: re-run the 10 prompts from `00-overview.md`,
use it daily for a week.

## Live URL

**Production**: https://hama-fx-ai.vercel.app

Aliases: `hama-fx-ai-mahamad-ahmads-projects.vercel.app`,
`hama-fx-ai-git-main-mahamad-ahmads-projects.vercel.app`.

## Vercel project

- Project ID: `prj_REDACTED`
- Team / org: `team_REDACTED` (`mahamad-ahmads-projects`)
- GitHub link: `HamaFx/HamaFX-Ai` (repoId `1249819677`), production branch `main`
- Root Directory: `apps/web`
- Framework preset: `nextjs`
- Node version: 24.x
- SSO deployment protection: **disabled** (we have our own password gate)
- `vercel.json`: framework + per-route function timeouts. **No crons** —
  Hobby plan caps cron jobs at once-per-day; re-add the schedules block from
  the original plan after upgrading to Pro or accepting daily-only cadence.

## Environment variables (production + preview)

Configured ✅:

- `APP_PASSWORD` (sensitive)
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET` (sensitive, 32-byte hex)
- `CRON_SECRET` (sensitive, 24-byte hex)
- All Supabase integration variables (auto-provisioned):
  `POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`, `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`,
  `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DATABASE`,
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

Code-level: `packages/shared/src/env.ts` accepts either `DATABASE_URL` or
`POSTGRES_URL` so the Supabase Vercel integration drops in seamlessly.

Not yet set (per-phase) — see § "Pending integrations" below.

## Database (Supabase Postgres)

Provisioned via the Vercel × Supabase Marketplace integration.
Connection: pooler at `aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543` (transaction
mode, `prepare: false` enforced by the Drizzle client).

### Extensions installed

| Extension | Schema | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plpgsql` | `pg_catalog` | 1.0 |
| `pgcrypto` | `extensions` | 1.3 |
| `uuid-ossp` | `extensions` | 1.1 |
| `vector` | `extensions` | 0.8.0 |
| `pg_stat_statements` | `extensions` | 1.11 |
| `supabase_vault` | `vault` | 0.3.1 |

`vector` and `pgcrypto` are required by our schema; install via
`pnpm --filter @hamafx/db migrate:setup-extensions` before the first
`migrate:apply` (idempotent).

### Schema (migration `0000_lazy_red_shift.sql`, applied)

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chat_threads`     | one row per conversation |
| `chat_messages`    | per-turn messages (parts as JSONB for tool UI) |
| `alerts`           | price / indicator / candle-close rules |
| `journal_entries`  | manual trade entries (no `user_id`, single user) |
| `news_articles`    | curated news, deduped by sha1(url) |
| `news_embeddings`  | pgvector(1536) — cosine HNSW index for RAG |
| `economic_events`  | macro calendar from TE + FRED |
| `snapshots`        | daily HLOC / pivots / ATR per symbol |
| `chat_telemetry`   | tokens + cost per chat turn (drives /settings/usage) |

17 indexes total, including the HNSW `news_embeddings_hnsw_idx` for vector
similarity search.

## Smoke tests (run at deploy time, all ✅)

```
GET /                      → 307 → /login
GET /chat                  → 307 → /login?next=/chat
GET /login                 → 200 (form renders)
POST /api/auth/login (bad) → 401 { code:"AUTH" }
GET  /api/cron/news (no auth) → 401 { code:"AUTH" }
```

### ⚠️ Pending integrations

These configure features that already have code wired up. Setting the env
var and redeploying is enough — no code changes needed.

| Integration | Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vercel AI Gateway** | 1b (chat) | ✅ wired & key set | `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. `/api/chat` streams via this. |
| ~~Upstash Redis~~ | ~~1a~~ | n/a | **Skipped.** Phase 1a switched to Next.js Data Cache — free, persistent on Vercel, single-flight built-in. Env vars `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*` are accepted but optional. |
| **Twelve Data** | 1a | ✅ wired & key set | `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY`. Free tier 800 reqs/day. |
| **Marketaux** | 1c | ✅ wired & key set | `MARKETAUX_API_KEY`. Free tier 100 reqs/day. |
| **FRED** | 1c | ✅ wired & key set | `FRED_API_KEY`. Free, registration only. |
| **Finnhub** | 1c (news fallback) | ⚠️ optional | `FINNHUB_API_KEY`. Currently only the price-fallback path uses it; news fallback deferred to Phase 2. |
| ~~Trading Economics~~ | ~~1c~~ | n/a | **Skipped.** FRED covers the calendar coverage we need; TE free guest tier is too thin to be useful. |
| **Alpha Vantage** | 1a (deep historicals) | ⚠️ optional | `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`. Not wired in code yet. |
| **Resend** | 1d (alert email) | ⚠️ **needed for alerts to email** | Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ALERT_FROM_EMAIL`, `ALERT_TO_EMAIL`. Without these, alerts evaluate + mark fired but no email goes out (logs a warning). |
| **Telegram bot** | 2 | not yet | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Alert delivery stub returns "deferred to Phase 2". |

After signing up for any of the above, set the env vars on Vercel
(**Settings → Environment Variables** for the project) — no redeploy needed,
Vercel rebuilds automatically when production env changes.

## Cron triggering — GitHub Actions

We've chosen **GitHub Actions external scheduler** over Vercel Pro. Configuration lives in `.github/workflows/cron-{news,calendar,alerts,embedding-backfill}.yml`. Each workflow `curl`s the corresponding `/api/cron/*` endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}` against `secrets.PRODUCTION_URL`.

### Schedule

| Endpoint                       | Workflow                            | Cadence (UTC)      | Per-hour |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------:|
| `/api/cron/news`               | `cron-news.yml`                     | `*/5 * * * *`       | 12       |
| `/api/cron/calendar`           | `cron-calendar.yml`                 | `*/15 * * * *`      | 4        |
| `/api/cron/alerts`             | `cron-alerts.yml`                   | `*/5 * * * *`       | 12       |
| `/api/cron/embedding-backfill` | `cron-embedding-backfill.yml`       | `*/30 * * * *`      | 2        |

GitHub Actions cron has 5-minute minimum granularity; sub-5-minute cadences are not possible without an external scheduler.

### Required repo secrets

Both secrets must be set on the GitHub repo (not the Vercel project) for the workflows to authenticate. Add them at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** — direct link: <https://github.com/HamaFx/HamaFX-Ai/settings/secrets/actions>.

- `PRODUCTION_URL` — base URL the workflows curl against, e.g. `https://hama-fx-ai.vercel.app` (no trailing slash).
- `CRON_SECRET` — must match the value of the `CRON_SECRET` env var on the Vercel project. Rotate both at the same time if you ever change it.

Without both secrets present, every scheduled run will fail with a 401 from the cron endpoint (visible in the workflow run logs).

### Risks

- **Delay during peak load:** Schedule events can be deferred 10–20 min during peak GitHub load.
- **Pause after inactivity:** GitHub may pause scheduled workflows after ~60 days of repo inactivity. Mitigation: any push (even a docs commit) resets the timer.
- **No SLA:** Personal-tier scheduling is best-effort.

### Alerts cadence trade-off (decision: option a)

**Decision:** ≥ 12 alerts cron firings/hour (5-min cadence via GitHub Actions). Requirement 6 §7's original ≥ 30/hour target was relaxed because GitHub Actions cannot schedule sub-5-minute jobs. The alerts pipeline still fires every 5 minutes, which is acceptable for the personal-mode use case (no day-trading off these notifications). See "Deviations from requirements" below for the requirement-level note.

**Flip path (option b) if real-world latency feels bad:** add a free [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) trigger for `/api/cron/alerts` at 1-minute cadence with the same `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` header. The endpoint is idempotent — alerts are marked fired only after Resend returns 2xx (see `packages/ai/src/alerts/delivery.ts` and Requirement 7 §5–§6) — so duplicate fires from GH Actions and cron-job.org are safe. If/when this is enabled, commit the cron-job.org job export to `.github/cron-job-org.json` (or a markdown record of the URL + headers configured).

### Where to find logs

- **Endpoint logs:** Vercel project → Functions → search by `/api/cron/<name>`.
- **Scheduler logs:** GitHub repo → Actions tab → pick a workflow run.
- **cron-job.org (if configured):** dashboard execution history.

### Manual trigger

Each workflow has `workflow_dispatch:` so you can run it on demand from the Actions tab without waiting for the scheduled time.

## Operational runbook

### Re-run database migrations

```bash
# 1. pull live env vars locally
pnpm dlx vercel env pull apps/web/.env.production --environment=production

# 2. load env + run migration
set -a; source apps/web/.env.production; set +a
pnpm --filter @hamafx/db migrate:setup-extensions   # only first time per DB
pnpm --filter @hamafx/db migrate:apply
```

### Trigger a deploy by hand

```bash
# Auto: just push to main (SSO protection is off, deploys are not blocked).

# Manual API trigger (bypass git):
curl -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v13/deployments?teamId=$TEAM&forceNew=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"hama-fx-ai","project":"prj_REDACTED","target":"production","gitSource":{"type":"github","ref":"main","repoId":1249819677}}'
```

### Rollback

Use the Vercel dashboard → **Deployments** → pick a previous READY one →
**Promote to Production**. No DB rollback needed since migrations are
forward-only.

## PWA smoke checklist

Before declaring Phase 1 complete, verify the PWA manually:

1. Production build (`pnpm --filter @hamafx/web build && pnpm --filter @hamafx/web start`) registers `/sw.js` after first paint (DevTools → Application → Service Workers).
2. Toggle the browser to offline; reload `/chat` → cached `/chat` document renders with the offline banner visible.
3. Toggle back online → banner disappears within ≤ 1s.
4. "Add to Home Screen" works on Android Chrome (manifest icon appears, launches `/chat`).
5. "Add to Home Screen" works on iOS Safari (apple-touch-icon used, launches `/chat`, splash image briefly shown on iPhone 14 Pro).

## Lighthouse usage

Mobile audits live in `tools/lighthouse/run.mjs` (see `tools/lighthouse/README.md`). Reports land in `docs/lighthouse/<UTC-timestamp>/`.

```bash
# Local production build
pnpm --filter @hamafx/web build && pnpm --filter @hamafx/web start
node tools/lighthouse/run.mjs \
  --base-url http://localhost:3000 \
  --cookie "hfx_auth=<value>" \
  --out docs/lighthouse

# Deployed Vercel URL
node tools/lighthouse/run.mjs \
  --base-url https://hama-fx-ai.vercel.app \
  --cookie "hfx_auth=<value>" \
  --out docs/lighthouse
```

Thresholds: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95. Failures listed in stdout; the run exits non-zero. Document waivers in `docs/lighthouse/waivers.md`.

## Eval harness usage

Local-only; runs the 10 acceptance prompts (`packages/ai/src/eval/prompts.json`) against a running app. Report markdown lands in `docs/eval/<UTC-timestamp>.md`.

```bash
# Against the local dev server
EVAL_COOKIE="hfx_auth=<value>" pnpm --filter @hamafx/ai eval --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Against the deployed app
pnpm --filter @hamafx/ai eval \
  --base-url https://hama-fx-ai.vercel.app \
  --cookie "hfx_auth=<value>" \
  --out docs/eval
```

No LLM-as-judge, no CI gate. Quality grading is manual.

## Deviations from requirements

Two deviations are accepted with rationale:

- **Requirement 6 §7 — alerts cron firing rate.** GitHub Actions cron has a 5-minute minimum granularity, so the alerts cron fires 12×/hour, not the 30 demanded by the requirement. We chose this trade-off over a Vercel Pro upgrade. Mitigation: optionally add a free [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) trigger pointed at `/api/cron/alerts` for sub-5-minute cadence.
- **Requirement 5 §10 — `/api/market/*` SW caching.** The optional stale-while-revalidate cache for `/api/market/*` is intentionally NOT implemented. Market data is timing-sensitive; serving 60-second-stale prices during network transitions is worse than serving none. The Next.js Data Cache layer in `packages/data/src/cache` is the canonical freshness boundary.
