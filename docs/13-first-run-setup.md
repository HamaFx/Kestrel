# 13 — First-Run Setup

> How a new user gets from a fresh clone to a working app.

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HamaFx/Kestrel.git
cd Kestrel
pnpm install
echo 'GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...' >> .env.local
pnpm dev:local                # http://localhost:3000
```

Prefer the guided path? Run **`pnpm setup`** instead of the manual steps above — it checks your machine, explains every choice (Simple vs Full mode), writes the config for you, and can start the app when you're ready.

That's it for native dev. The rest of this page explains what's actually happening and what the choices mean.

## What Gets Auto-Generated

In `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (i.e. local dev and tests), the web app's `getServerEnv()` and `getAuthEnv()` helpers fill in three secrets if they're missing:

| Secret                            | Purpose                           | Min length              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` / `AUTH_SECRET` | Sign NextAuth.js v5 JWTs          | 32 chars                |
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`               | AES-256-GCM key for BYOK payloads | 32 bytes (64 hex chars) |
| `CRON_SECRET`                     | Bearer token for `/api/cron/*`    | 16 chars                |

They're generated with `crypto.randomBytes(N)`, persisted to `.kestrel/dev-secrets.json` (gitignored), and reloaded on the next boot. This means **encrypted BYOK keys survive restarts** in dev — the encrypted data and the encryption key move together.

In production every secret **must** be set explicitly via env. The schema's refinement rejects a missing value with a clear error message naming the variable.

## What's Actually Required

For local dev to start, the schema only requires:

- **One AI provider key** — the simplest path is Google Gemini's free tier: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...`
- Nothing else. The PGlite database auto-creates on first boot. Migrations auto-apply. Auth secrets auto-generate. Everything else has defaults.

## Choosing a Provider

The web app's BYOK registry supports 10 providers. The registry lives in `packages/ai/src/byok-providers.ts`.

| Provider           | Free tier | Notes                                |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Google AI (Gemini) | ✓         | Easiest to start, generous quota     |
| Google Vertex AI   | —         | Enterprise Google Cloud, same models |
| Anthropic (Claude) | —         | Best reasoning, paid                 |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT)   | —         | GPT-4o, vision + embedding           |
| Groq               | ✓         | Fast Llama/Mixtral inference         |
| Mistral            | —         | EU-hosted option                     |
| OpenRouter         | —         | One key for 100+ models              |
| xAI (Grok)         | —         | Strong reasoning                     |
| DeepSeek           | —         | Low-cost open weights                |
| IAMHC API          | —         | Aggregated multi-model access        |

You can also pass an `OPENAI_API_KEY`-style env var directly without going through the registry — `resolveUserModel()` will surface operator-provided keys as a fallback when no BYOK is configured yet.

## Optional live web research

The Fundamental agent can optionally search the live public web for current macroeconomic and geopolitical context. This is disabled by default and does not use Google Vertex grounding.

Set these server-only variables in Vercel, Docker, or your worker environment:

```env
WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=exa
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-key
# Optional provider-level alternatives:
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-brave-key
WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=tavily,brave
```

Exa is the default semantic search provider. Tavily and Brave are optional provider-level alternatives; this does not change the selected chat or analysis mode. Search results are normalized, cached briefly, traced, limited per turn, sanitized as untrusted data, and rendered as clickable citations. If all providers fail, the Fundamental agent receives an explicit unavailable status instead of silently claiming that it searched the web.

## The /onboarding Wizard

First-time users land on `/onboarding` after `/register`. The wizard has four steps:

1. **Display name** — what the agent calls you
2. **Trading preferences** — timezone, default symbol from the supported gold, forex, and crypto catalog (XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, and more)
3. **AI provider** — pick one of the 10 cards, paste your key, hit **Test Connection** to verify, or skip and configure later in Settings
4. **Confirmation** — review and finish

You can return to any step via Settings. The wizard never blocks — the chat works as long as you have _some_ AI key set, either via wizard, Settings, or env.

## The `pnpm setup` CLI Wizard

The command-line installer (`scripts/setup/`) is the recommended first step for both local and Docker installs. It runs on Node.js only — no dependencies — so it works before `pnpm install`.

The flow has seven steps:

1. **Prerequisites** — Node 22.13+, pnpm/Corepack, Git, Docker detection with guidance.
2. **Mode** — arrow-key picker: **Simple** (PGlite, no Docker) vs **Full** (Docker + pgvector + worker).
3. **Existing install** — if `.env`/`node_modules` exist: Continue / Repair / Fresh start.
4. **Market data** (optional) — checkbox multi-select for Finnhub, Marketaux, FRED, Alpha Vantage with masked key input.
5. **Config** — generates secrets from a shared template, backs up existing files, shows a masked diff, and validates `docker compose config` in Full mode.
6. **Install** — `pnpm install` (frozen lockfile, with fallback).
7. **Launch** — starts the app, waits for `/api/health/public`, opens the browser, and prints a Getting Started guide.

Useful flags:

```bash
pnpm setup --dry-run            # preview every change, write nothing
pnpm setup --mode=simple --yes  # quiet, non-interactive
pnpm setup --json               # machine-readable result on stdout
pnpm setup --fresh              # regenerate config (backed up first)
```

Ctrl+C anywhere aborts cleanly with a friendly message (exit 130).

## Docker / Production Paths

- **Docker compose** (`./docker/init-secrets.sh && docker compose up -d`):
  Postgres 16 + pgvector + the app. Follow the env file instructions in the compose file. pgvector requires this mode — PGlite doesn't ship the vector extension. See [11-self-hosting.md](./11-self-hosting.md).

- **Cloud** (Vercel + GCE VM): see [08-deployment.md](./08-deployment.md). All three secrets must be set in Vercel's dashboard; the VM reads from `/opt/kestrel/.env` on disk.

## What about the existing /settings/api-keys page?

It's still there and uses the same provider registry. Per-provider controls:

- Show / hide key toggle
- **Test Connection** button (calls `/api/settings/test-provider` to instantiate the provider SDK)
- Dirty-state indicator ("Unsaved changes — click Save")
- Last-validated indicator when the SDK instantiates successfully
- **Bulk Test** button to test all configured providers at once
- Per-provider usage stats

You can mix and match providers — the routing layer in `packages/ai/src/model.ts` picks the strongest configured provider per domain and falls back to others when a provider doesn't support a specific capability (e.g. DeepSeek has no vision model).
