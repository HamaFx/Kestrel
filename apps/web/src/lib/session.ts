/**
 * Trading-session helper — converts a wall-clock instant into a
 * session label that drives the empty-state quick prompts on
 * /chat.
 *
 * Phase A — UX_UPGRADE_PLAN.md item 3.
 *
 * Sessions (UTC-anchored; the cuts are global because the FX
 * market sessions are global, not local):
 *   00:00 – 07:00 UTC  Asian
 *   07:00 – 12:00 UTC  London
 *   12:00 – 17:00 UTC  NY
 *   17:00 – 24:00 UTC  Closed (after-hours)
 *
 * Weekend window: Friday 22:00 UTC (inclusive) – Sunday 22:00 UTC
 * (exclusive). During the weekend, market microstructure is
 * different — prompts lean toward "weekly review" framing.
 *
 * Why no timezone param: the session is a property of the
 * underlying market, not of the user. A trader in Tokyo and a
 * trader in New York both see "London open" at 09:00 UTC. We
 * expose the user's tz separately for display formatting
 * (e.g. "London open at 16:00 your time"), but that is the
 * job of a different helper.
 *
 * Pure function: no I/O. Tested in apps/web/test/session.test.ts.
