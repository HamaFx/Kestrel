// GET /api/cron/embedding-backfill — finds news_articles without embeddings
// and embeds them in batches via the AI Gateway. Capped per run so it stays
// under Vercel's function timeout regardless of backlog.
//
// Phase 8 PR-9: this route is now a **manual-fallback path**. The
// scheduled invocation runs on the GCE worker VM via a systemd timer
// (`kestrel-job-embedding-backfill.timer`), where it's not bound by the
// 60s function ceiling. The route stays here so:
//
//   1. We can hand-trigger via curl during a worker outage:
//      `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" $URL/api/cron/embedding-backfill`
//   2. Existing scripts / docs that reference the URL keep working.
//
// The cap stays low (256 rows) because the route still has the 60s ceiling.
// The worker job ramps to 1024 rows per run — see apps/worker/src/jobs/embedding-backfill.ts.
