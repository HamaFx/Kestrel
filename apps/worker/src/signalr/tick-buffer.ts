// Per-symbol tick buffer.
//
// The SignalR consumer dispatches `BiquoteTick` events as fast as BiQuote
// pushes them — that's many hundreds per second across active symbols
// during high-volume windows. Writing every one of those to Postgres would
// burn quota and starve other queries.
//
// `TickBuffer` collapses the firehose into the LATEST tick per symbol. The
// flush loop drains it once per second and UPSERTs into `live_ticks`. We
// also keep a slot for "ticks since last drain" so callers can enforce a
// minimum of one DB write per N ticks per symbol if they want.
//
// This module is pure data — no IO, no logging — so it's trivially
// testable and reusable from the candle aggregator (which wants the same
// per-symbol coalescing semantics over a different drain cadence).
