/**
 * Postgres advisory lock for multi-worker workflow claim safety.
 *
 * The durable full-analysis queue's `claimNextFullAnalysisRun` uses a
 * read-verify-write pattern that is safe for a single worker. When multiple
 * workers are deployed, a Postgres advisory lock serializes the claim scan
 * so two workers cannot both claim the same pending run.
 *
 * Advisory locks are session-scoped: they are automatically released when
 * the DB connection is returned to the pool (or the session disconnects),
 * so a worker crash never leaves a stuck lock. The lock is best-effort:
 * if the DB is not Postgres or the call fails, the caller falls back to
 * the existing read-verify-write pattern.
