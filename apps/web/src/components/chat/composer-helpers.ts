 * Why pure functions in their own file:
 *   - The existing vitest config only matches .ts test files in
 *     the Node environment and does not run .tsx component tests.
 *     Keeping the logic in a .ts module lets us test thresholds
 *     cleanly without adding a new test infrastructure.
 *   - The constants MAX_TEXT_CHARS / SOFT_LIMIT_CHARS were inlined
 *     in composer.tsx; centralising them here means a future
 *     "lower the cap" change touches one file.
