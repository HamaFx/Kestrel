## [Unreleased]

> The upcoming public OSS release is a single-user, self-hosted BYOK preview. Shared multi-user/RLS mode and hosted billing are not part of this release.

### Added

- **Documentation overhaul:** current procedural docs for the single-user OSS release, replacing the old 15-doc set:
  - `docs/01-architecture.md` — system design and deployment modes
  - `docs/02-data-flows.md` — provider flows and licensing responsibilities
  - `docs/03-backend-api.md` — API architecture and route-boundary rules
  - `docs/04-frontend-ux.md` — frontend architecture and UX requirements
  - `docs/05-security-auth-compliance.md` — auth, BYOK encryption, RLS, and self-hosting security
  - `docs/06-deployment-self-hosting.md` — deployment entry point
  - `docs/07-agent-understanding.md` — coding-agent guide
  - `docs/08-agent-setup-run.md` — setup and troubleshooting
  - `docs/14-oss-release-checklist.md` — public-release boundary and operator checklist
- **Advanced community docs:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Legacy documentation references were removed from the public guide; the current procedural docs live in `docs/`.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` deleted — replaced by `docs/07-agent-understanding.md` + `docs/08-agent-setup-run.md`
- Old numbered and review/audit docs were replaced by the current procedural documentation set.
- Community security and contribution guides were refreshed for the OSS release.

### Security

- Documented known auth bugs in `docs/05-security-auth-compliance.md` §4:
  - Token version not checked in JWT callback (Critical)
  - `__system__` user assumption in cron jobs (Critical)
  - Session validation gaps for deleted users (High)
- Documented data provider licensing gaps — no terms files exist in repo

### Release boundary and remaining considerations

| Area                       | Current OSS status                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared RLS/multi-user mode | Intentionally blocked until every user-data query establishes tenant context and the PostgreSQL isolation suite passes |
| Hosted billing             | Separate hosted-product track; not enabled as a self-hosted OSS service                                                |
| Data provider licensing    | Each operator must review provider terms and obtain any required redistribution rights                                 |
| Disaster recovery          | Docker backup/restore is smoke-tested; operators must still configure off-host copies and rehearse recovery            |
| Secret rotation            | Guarded maintenance utility exists; operators must stop writers and retain recovery material                           |
