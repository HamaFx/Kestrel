#   ./docker/restore-db.sh latest
#   ./docker/restore-db.sh kestrel-20260810T030000Z.dump.gz

# The backup volume is mounted only in the backup image. This command uses a
# short-lived backup-image container to read the archive and connect to db over
# the private Compose network. It stops app/worker/backup writers, replaces the
# database contents, and starts the stack again only after pg_restore succeeds.
