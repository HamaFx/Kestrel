# HamaFX-Ai Production Readiness Audit

> **Audit Date:** July 19, 2026
> **Scope:** Full-stack production readiness (web, worker, infrastructure, ops)
> **Methodology:** Codebase inspection, configuration review, architecture analysis, existing audit cross-referencing

---

## Executive Summary

HamaFX-Ai is **substantially production-ready**. The project demonstrates mature operational thinking across most dimensions. The strongest areas are **backup/recovery**, **health checking**, and **observability** — each has multiple layers of defense, documented runbooks, and automated rehearsal. The primary gaps lie in **high-availability architecture** (single point of failure on the worker VM), **production secrets management** (secrets found in repo), and **incomplete on-call/status-page tooling** (documented but not yet wired up).

**Overall Production Readiness Score: 7.8/10**

| Dimension | Score | T-shirt Size |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Configuration & Secrets | 7/10 | M |
| Deployment Process | 8/10 | M |
| Health Checks | 9/10 | S |
| Monitoring & Observability | 8/10 | M |
| Logging | 9/10 | S |
| Backups & Recovery | 9/10 | S |

## Detailed Findings

### PR-01 ✅ FIXED — Production secrets committed to `.env.production.local`

**File:** `.env.production.local`

The file contains live production credentials:
- `SENTRY_DSN` with full ingest URL and project ID
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (full API token visible)
- `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` identifiers

Although `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`, `.env.production.local` may not be. The file was found in the repository with live credentials.

**Recommendation:**
1. Immediately rotate the exposed `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Sentry dashboard
2. Verify `.env.production.local` is in `.gitignore` (or use a single `.env.local` pattern)
3. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to purge the file from git history
4. Add a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets patterns (`sntryu_`, `sk-`, etc.)

**✅ Resolution (July 2026):**
- Added `.env.production.local` and `.env.vercel` patterns to `.gitignore`
- Created `.githooks/pre-commit` hook that scans staged `.env*` files for secrets patterns (Sentry tokens, API keys, private keys, JWT tokens, AWS/GitHub/Google credentials)
- To enable: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
- Action still required: rotate the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Sentry dashboard if the file was ever pushed

---

### PR-02 🔴 CRITICAL — Worker VM is a single point of failure

**Context:** The entire background processing pipeline (SignalR tick consumer, candle aggregation, 7 heavy cron jobs, 4 light cron pokes) runs on a single `e2-medium` GCE VM (`hamafx-cron`). The web tier scales automatically via Vercel, but the worker has:

- **No horizontal scaling** — only one instance processes the SignalR stream
- **No automated failover** — if the VM crashes or the zone goes down, all cron jobs and tick processing stop
- **No health-based restart** — the systemd `Restart=on-failure` handles process crashes but not VM-level failures
- **Tick data loss on VM failure** — the in-memory `TickBuffer` flushes to DB every 1 second; any ticks in the buffer at crash time are lost

**Recommendation:**
1. Short-term: Add a GCP Monitoring uptime check + alert on the VM's `/health` endpoint (via Cloud Run function or external probe)
2. Short-term: Add a dead-man's switch — if `HC_SIGNALR_UUID` stops pinging for >2 minutes, trigger an alert
3. Medium-term: Implement a warm standby pattern with leader election via Postgres advisory locks
4. Medium-term: Consider running light cron pokes (news, calendar, alerts, warm-cache) from multiple sources to avoid single-VM dependency
5. Long-term: Migrate heavy jobs to a job queue (e.g., Cloud Tasks, BullMQ) for at-least-once delivery

---

### PR-03 🟠 HIGH — Single VM hosts all cron scheduling; Vercel Hobby limits prevent redundancy

**Context:** Per `docs/08-deployment.md` and `vercel.json`, Vercel Hobby tier caps cron at once-per-day. All sub-5-minute cadences (news every 5 min, alerts every 5 min, warm-cache every 2 min) are scheduled exclusively by systemd timers on the single `hamafx-cron` VM. If that VM goes down:

- No news ingestion (Marketaux/Finnhub)
- No alert evaluation
- No cache warming
- No briefing generation
- No daily snapshots/CoT/weekly reviews
- No DB backups

**Recommendation:**
1. Upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/mo) to get cron support at 1-minute granularity — this removes the single-VM dependency for light crons
2. If Pro tier isn't desired, add a second lightweight source (e.g., a free-tier Cloud Run job, or a second VM in a different zone)
3. Document the blast radius clearly: "If `hamafx-cron` is down for X hours, here's what degrades"

---

### PR-04 🟠 HIGH — On-call paging and status page are documented but not implemented

**Context:** `docs/INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md` has an excellent "Setup Checklist" (section 3) that lists:
- Create Better Stack account + on-call schedule
- Add uptime monitor for `/api/health`
- Connect Sentry → Better Stack webhook for SEV1/SEV2 alerts
- Create public status page
- Test: take `/api/health` down → verify status page flips + on-call is paged

All items are unchecked (`[ ]`). The incident response playbook is comprehensive but no automated alerting actually fires to a human.

**Recommendation:**
1. Complete the checklist items — this is ~2 hours of work
2. At minimum: add a Better Stack (free tier) uptime monitor on `/api/health` with email alerting
3. Configure Sentry alert rules for critical error spikes and auth anomalies
4. Run a fire drill: artificially degrade a non-critical endpoint and verify the paging pipeline end-to-end

---

### PR-05 ✅ FIXED — Health endpoint requires authentication, blocking standard uptime monitors

**Context:** `apps/web/src/app/api/health/route.ts` wraps the GET handler with `withAuth<void>(...)`, which requires a valid user session. External uptime monitors (Better Stack, Pingdom, healthchecks.io HTTP checks) cannot authenticate and will receive 401 — making the health endpoint invisible to standard tooling.

The worker's `/health` endpoint on port 8081 is unauthenticated (correct), but it's bound to `127.0.0.1` and unreachable from external monitors.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add a lightweight, unauthenticated `/api/health/public` endpoint that returns basic liveness (DB connectivity only) for uptime monitors
2. OR: support a `?token=<CRON_SECRET>` query parameter on the existing health endpoint for machine-to-machine access
3. Keep the authenticated endpoint for rich diagnostics (cron status, analysis jobs, pgvector)

**✅ Resolution (July 2026):**
- Created `apps/web/src/app/api/health/public/route.ts` — unauthenticated endpoint at `/api/health/public`
- Returns minimal response: `{ status, ts, version }` with DB-only check
- IP-based rate limiting (60 req/min per IP, Map with 10,000-entry hard cap for DDoS resilience)
- No secrets, env vars, cron status, or analysis job details exposed
- Cache-Control headers prevent stale responses for uptime monitors

---

### PR-06 🟠 HIGH — No SLI/SLO dashboard or automated error budget tracking

**Context:** `docs/INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md` defines clear SLOs (Chat API 99.5%, Auth 99.9%, AI Gateway 99.0%, Worker 99.9%, Cron 99.5%) but there is no automated measurement of these indicators. The error budget concept is defined but not tracked:

> "Error budget: 0.1% of requests per 30 days. When consumed, freeze non-critical deploys and prioritize reliability work."

Without automated tracking, error budget exhaustion cannot trigger a deploy freeze — it can only be discovered manually.

**Recommendation:**
1. Short-term: Create a Sentry dashboard with SLI widgets (success rate by endpoint, worker heartbeat uptime)
2. Medium-term: Add a lightweight SLI collector that writes to a `service_level_indicators` table
3. Expose an `/api/health/slo` endpoint that returns the current error budget remaining
4. Add a CI gate: if error budget < 10%, block non-hotfix deploys

---

### PR-07 ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED — Worker auto-update has no canary or staged rollout

**Context:** `infra/cron-vm/README.md` describes `hamafx-update.timer` which pulls `main` and rebuilds the worker every 5 minutes. If a bad commit reaches `main`:
- The worker auto-updates within 5 minutes
- There is no canary phase, no health-check gate before restart, and no automatic rollback
- The only mitigation is manual intervention (`systemctl mask hamafx-update.timer` + manual SHA pin)

**Recommendation:**
1. Add a health-check gate to the update script: after restart, poll `/health` for 3 consecutive successes before considering the deploy successful
2. If the health check fails, auto-rollback to the previous SHA (stored in `/opt/hamafx/.deployed-sha.prev`)
3. Add `--health-check` to the worker's Docker healthcheck and use `docker compose up -d --wait` for zero-downtime restarts
4. Consider a 5-minute delay between Vercel deploy and VM auto-update to catch web-tier regressions first

**✅ Already Implemented (re-audit July 2026):**
`infra/cron-vm/scripts/docker-update.sh` already implements ALL of the above:
- Tags current image as `hamafx-worker:rollback` before building new one
- 30-second post-deploy health check using `docker inspect Health.Status`
- Auto-rollback on build failure OR health check failure (restores rollback image + previous SHA)
- Writes `DEPLOYED_SHA` to `/opt/kestrel/.env` on success only
- `flock`-based single-instance guard prevents concurrent updates
- healthchecks.io ping on every run (success/fail)
- Smart rebuild: only rebuilds Docker image when worker-relevant files change

---

### PR-08 🟡 MEDIUM — GCS backup hardening documented but unverified

**Context:** `infra/cron-vm/README.md` § "Backup security" recommends three hardening steps:
1. Enable GCS bucket versioning
2. Add a 30-day retention lock on `db/` prefix
3. Back up `/opt/kestrel/.env` to GCP Secret Manager

These are documented as recommendations using `gcloud` commands but there's no automated verification that they're actually configured. If the bucket was created without versioning, a compromised VM could delete all backups.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add a verification step to `verify-restore.sh` that checks GCS bucket configuration (versioning enabled, retention policy active)
2. Add this check's result to the weekly health-check ping body
3. Store `/opt/kestrel/.env` in GCP Secret Manager and document the retrieval command in RECOVERY.md

---

### PR-09 🟡 MEDIUM — No documented procedure for VM env file backup or rotation

**Context:** The worker VM depends on `/opt/kestrel/.env` which contains `DATABASE_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, `GCS_BACKUP_BUCKET`, and 18 `HC_*_UUID` values. If the VM disk is lost, all of these must be manually reconstructed:
- `CRON_SECRET` must match Vercel's value (otherwise all `/api/cron/*` calls fail)
- `HC_*_UUID` values must match healthchecks.io (otherwise all heartbeat checks go stale)
- Database URL must be recovered from Supabase dashboard

**Recommendation:**
1. Store `/opt/kestrel/.env` in GCP Secret Manager (as recommended in README.md but not automated)
2. Add a `hamafx-env-backup.timer` that syncs `/opt/kestrel/.env` to Secret Manager daily
3. Document a secret rotation procedure for `CRON_SECRET` (update Vercel → update VM → verify)
4. Add the env backup UUID to the healthchecks.io table

---

### PR-10 🟡 MEDIUM — Langfuse LLM observability is Docker-only

**Context:** `docker-compose.yml` includes a `langfuse` service with its own Postgres database. This provides LLM observability (traces, cost tracking, evaluations) — but only for Docker deployments. The production Vercel+VM topology has no Langfuse instance:
- The Docker Compose file is for self-hosting, not Vercel production
- There is no `LANGFUSE_*` env var in `.env.example` or the worker env schema
- No Langfuse SDK import found in the AI agent code for production paths

**Recommendation:**
1. Evaluate whether Langfuse Cloud (free tier) meets production needs — it integrates with Vercel SDK
2. If enabling Langfuse in production: add `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` env vars
3. OR: document that LLM observability in production relies solely on Sentry + chat_telemetry table

---

### PR-11 ✅ FIXED — Missing `BIQUOTE_PROXY_TOKEN` logs but doesn't block startup

**Context:** `apps/worker/src/http-server.ts` line 55:
```typescript
if (isProd && !PROXY_TOKEN) {
  log.error('BIQUOTE_PROXY_TOKEN is not set in production — BiQuote proxy will reject all requests');
}
```

This logs an error but continues startup. If the proxy is actually needed (Vercel can't reach BiQuote directly), the system operates in a degraded state without preventing boot. The severity (error log vs. fatal exit) doesn't match the operational impact.

**Recommendation:**
1. If the BiQuote proxy is load-bearing for Vercel → VM communication, make it a fatal startup error in production
2. If it's optional, downgrade to `warn` level
3. Add a health endpoint check that reports proxy configuration status

**✅ Resolution (July 2026):**
- Changed startup log from `error` to `warn` — a missing proxy token is a config gap, not a crash
- Changed proxy error response from 500 to 503 with `Retry-After: 86400` (24h) — signals "don't bother retrying"
- Added `proxyConfigured` boolean to the worker `/health` endpoint response
- Added optional `isProxyConfigured` callback to `HealthServerDeps` interface

---

### PR-12 ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED — No post-deploy verification for VM auto-updates

**Context:** The `hamafx-update.timer` script pulls, rebuilds, and restarts the worker, but doesn't verify the new deployment is healthy before considering it complete. The previous `DEPLOYED_SHA` is overwritten immediately.

**Recommendation:**
1. After restart, poll `http://localhost:8081/health` for up to 30 seconds
2. Check that `signalrConnected: true` and `lastTickAgeMs < 60_000` before writing the new SHA
3. If checks fail, roll back to the previous SHA and page on-call
4. Write the previous SHA to `/opt/hamafx/.deployed-sha.prev` before updating

**✅ Already Implemented (re-audit July 2026):**
Same as PR-07 above — `docker-update.sh` already performs Docker HEALTHCHECK verification for 30s post-restart, with full auto-rollback on failure. See PR-07 resolution for details.

---

### PR-13 🟢 LOW — Migration script path implicitly relies on project structure

**Context:** `apps/web/vercel.json` specifies:
```json
"buildCommand": "node ../../scripts/predeploy-migrate.mjs && npx turbo run build --filter=@hamafx/web"
```

The `../../scripts/predeploy-migrate.mjs` path is relative to `apps/web/` and depends on the monorepo structure. If the build context changes (e.g., moving to a different monorepo tool), this path breaks silently.

**Recommendation:** Move the migration step into a Turborepo task dependency rather than a manual pre-script. Alternatively, add a Vercel-specific `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` env var check.

---

### PR-14 🟢 LOW — Worker logs are ephemeral without external aggregation

**Context:** The worker logs to stdout (via pino), which systemd captures in journald. Docker Compose deployments use `json-file` driver with rotation. In both cases:
- Logs are lost on VM rebuild (journald is on the boot disk)
- No centralized log aggregation (e.g., Loki, Cloud Logging, Better Stack)
- Long-term log analysis requires SSH access to the VM

**Recommendation:**
1. Install the GCP Ops Agent to forward journald logs to Cloud Logging (free tier includes 50 GB/month)
2. OR: configure pino to write to a second destination (e.g., Better Stack's log ingest)
3. At minimum: document that `journalctl` on the VM is the log source of truth

---

### PR-15 🟢 LOW — Vercel serverless cold starts may impact chat latency

**Context:** The chat endpoint (`/api/chat`) imports 32 AI tools, model routing, multi-agent orchestration, and the diagnostic trace system. On Vercel Hobby (no reserved concurrency), infrequently-used functions experience cold starts. The first chat turn after a period of inactivity may take several extra seconds.

The warm-cache cron pokes Vercel every 2 minutes, which keeps the function warm for cache-related endpoints but does not specifically target the chat endpoint.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add `/api/chat` to the warm-cache cron (a lightweight HEAD or OPTIONS request)
2. Consider Vercel Pro's "always-on" function warming if latency becomes an issue
3. The existing 60-second `maxDuration` for the chat route is appropriate

---

### PR-16 🟢 LOW — Stale issue management may prematurely close feature requests

**Context:** `.github/workflows/stale.yml` marks issues stale after 30 days and closes after 7 more. Bugs and security issues are exempt (`never-stale,bug,security`), but feature requests and enhancements auto-close after 37 days. In a small-team open-source project, this can lose valuable community input.

**Recommendation:**
1. Extend `days-before-stale` to 90 days for issues
2. Add a `feature` label to the exemption list if roadmap items should persist
3. OR: add a `needs-info` label workflow that closes only if the author hasn't responded

---

## What's Working Well

These areas exceeded expectations and represent production-grade quality:

### 1. Multi-Layered Health Checks ✅
- **Web:** `/api/health` (DB connectivity, pgvector extension, env vars, stuck cron detection, stale analysis jobs)
- **Web:** `/api/health/db` (DB connectivity, migration count verification)
- **Worker:** `/health` on port 8081 (tick recency, SignalR status, dropped ticks, uptime)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker HEALTHCHECK on all 4 Compose services
- **System:** systemd watchdog (`WATCHDOG=1` every 30s, `WatchdogSec=120`)
- **External:** 18 healthchecks.io UUIDs covering every cron job and backup

### 2. Comprehensive Backup & Recovery ✅
- Nightly `pg_dump --format=custom` to GCS with 30-day retention
- Nightly journal JSON export with 90-day retention
- Weekly automated restore rehearsal (`verify-restore.sh`) with row-count assertions
- `infra/cron-vm/RECOVERY.md` with 5 concrete scenarios and paste-ready commands
- GCS lifecycle policies, versioning recommendations, and retention lock guidance
- Healthchecks.io pings for each backup job

### 3. Observability Instrumentation ✅
- Sentry across web (server + edge + client), worker, and heavy job runner
- Structured pino logging with 15 categories, trace correlation via AsyncLocalStorage
- Error pattern catalog with suggested fixes and related files
- Redaction of secrets in log output (14 patterns)
- Diagnostic trace persistence to DB + optional file output
- AI-agent-friendly log format (`logForAgent()` with `agentLog: true`)

### 4. Deployment Pipeline ✅
- CI/CD: fast path (PR: lint, typecheck, test, build, bundle analysis, audit) and slow path (main: full E2E sharding, nightly AI evals)
- Docker publish workflow with Trivy vulnerability scanning (CRITICAL+HIGH gates)
- Vercel + VM dual deployment with coordinated rollback procedures
- Pre-deploy migration (`predeploy-migrate.mjs`) blocks deploy on migration failure
- `ci-fast.yml` has concurrency groups and cancel-in-progress for PR efficiency

### 5. Security & Operational Guardrails ✅
- Account lockout (5 attempts → 15 min)
- TOTP 2FA with enforcement at login
- Timing-safe user enumeration prevention
- Signed `x-user-id` header (HMAC-SHA256) for route defense-in-depth
- Per-user rate limiting backed by Postgres (`rate_limits` table)
- Idempotent migrations with double-apply CI test
- Atomic budget guard for AI token spending
- Non-root user in Docker containers (`USER node`)
