## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Kestrel, **do not open a public issue**.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository (the **Report a vulnerability** button in the repository's **Security** tab). If private reporting is unavailable, open a minimal issue asking the maintainers to enable it; do not include exploit details or secrets in that issue.

Include the following in the private report:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. The potential impact (data exposure, privilege escalation, financial impact, etc.)
4. Any suggested mitigations

If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainers through the repository's current GitHub profile/contact channels rather than relying on an unverified email address.

**Response timeline:**

| Step               | Target                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Acknowledgment     | 48 hours                                         |
| Initial assessment | 5 business days                                  |
| Fix or mitigation  | 30 days (severity-dependent)                     |
| Public disclosure  | After fix is released, coordinated with reporter |

Please practice responsible disclosure. We commit to not taking legal action against reporters who act in good faith.

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication

Kestrel uses NextAuth.js v5 with a Credentials provider (email + password, bcrypt). Sessions are JWT-based with a 30-day expiry. Account lockout activates after 5 failed login attempts (15-minute lockout).

**Auth hardening completed** — see [docs/10-security.md](docs/10-security.md) for the current self-hosted security model.

| Issue                                                                                                   | Severity | Status   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Token version now checked in `session()` callback every 5 min — invalidates on mismatch                 | Critical | ✅ Fixed |
| Signed `x-user-id` header (HMAC-SHA256) prevents spoofing; cron jobs use proper scoping                 | Critical | ✅ Fixed |
| `authorized()` + `jwt()` + `session()` callbacks collectively validate user existence and token version | High     | ✅ Fixed |
| TOTP 2FA enforced at login                                                                              | High     | ✅ Fixed |
| Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-min timeout)                                                | Medium   | ✅ Fixed |

If you are working on auth code, read the current implementation at `apps/web/src/auth.ts` and `apps/web/src/auth.config.ts`.

### BYOK API Key Encryption

User-provided AI provider keys (BYOK) are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with the `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` environment variable (32-byte hex key). Keys are decrypted in memory only during tool execution.

**Responsibilities:**

- `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` must be a strong, randomly generated 32-byte hex value
- Never commit `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to version control
- Never log decrypted API key values
- The `redactSecrets()` utility (`packages/ai/src/diagnostics/redact.ts`) automatically redacts keys from diagnostic traces — ensure any new logging flows through it

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Fresh self-hosted installs are single-user only (`MULTI_USER_ENABLED=0`, `KESTREL_ENABLE_RLS=0`, `REGISTRATION_MODE=owner-first`). Multi-user/RLS mode is disabled in this OSS release. The environment parser, database client, and runtime migration entrypoint reject either flag before the application starts or mutates the database. This boundary remains in place until every user-data query establishes tenant context and the PostgreSQL isolation suite passes.

Because the current query paths do not consistently establish tenant context, the single-user runtime migrator removes the unconditional RLS policies after applying the schema. Do not treat `userId` predicates alone as a substitute for database tenant isolation. When shared mode is eventually enabled, it must use PostgreSQL, a dedicated `ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` BYPASSRLS role for worker/cron operations, and the complete migration chain.

### Billing Webhook

The NOWPayments billing webhook (`/api/billing/webhook`) verifies HMAC-SHA512 signatures on every request before any business logic runs. The `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` must be kept secret and set in the NOWPayments dashboard.

**Safety gate requirements** (must be met before enabling paid plans):

1. Webhook signature verification on every request ✅
2. Dead-letter queue for failed processing (`ipn_events` table) ✅
3. Sentry capture of webhook errors ✅
4. Signature-failure metric emitted in code; Sentry threshold alert and paging integration remain operator configuration ⚠️ verify in the active Sentry project

### CSRF Protection

All state-changing API requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) require a CSRF double-submit cookie. The `hfx_csrf` cookie must match the `x-csrf-token` header. This is enforced in the request proxy (`apps/web/src/proxy.ts`).

### Content Security Policy

The CSP header is set in `next.config.mjs`:

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'nonce-<per-request-nonce>' https://s3.tradingview.com https://d3js.org;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://s3.tradingview.com;
img-src 'self' data: blob: https:;
font-src 'self' data:;
connect-src 'self' wss: https:;
```

> **Note:** Application script CSP uses per-request nonces. Inline styles remain permitted for framework/component compatibility; script `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` are not permitted.

### Self-Hosted Deployment Security

The Docker quick start binds web, database, and optional Langfuse ports to localhost and runs the web/worker containers as non-root users. If you expose the app publicly, you still need a reverse proxy with TLS, host firewall rules, and an operator-managed backup/restore plan.

Self-hosters are responsible for:

- Securing the underlying infrastructure (OS, network, firewall)
- Using a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy) with TLS/SSL
- Generating strong secrets (`AUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`)
- Keeping `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` backed up — losing it makes all stored BYOK keys unrecoverable
- Restricting access to the database
- Regularly updating dependencies (`pnpm update` + Dependabot PRs)

### Data Provider Licensing

Kestrel integrates with multiple market data providers (BiQuote, Finnhub, Marketaux, FRED, Binance, CFTC). **No provider terms of service are included in this repository.** If you redistribute market data to paying subscribers, you are responsible for verifying each provider's redistribution terms and obtaining appropriate licenses. See [docs/02-data-flows.md](docs/02-data-flows.md) for the licensing responsibility guidance.

| Measure               | Workflow                          | What it catches                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| CodeQL analysis       | `codeql.yml` (weekly + PRs)       | Code injection, path traversal, XSS patterns     |
| Trivy container scan  | `docker-publish.yml` (on release) | CRITICAL + HIGH vulnerabilities in Docker images |
| Dependabot            | Weekly                            | Outdated dependencies with known CVEs            |
| ESLint security rules | `ci-fast.yml` (every PR)          | Common security anti-patterns                    |

## Secret Management

| Environment         | Method                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local dev           | Auto-generated to `.kestrel/dev-secrets.json` (gitignored)       |
| Docker              | `.env` file (gitignored, from `.env.example` template)           |
| Production (hosted) | GCP Secret Manager (`SECRETS_VAULT_PROVIDER=gcp-secret-manager`) |
| Self-hosted         | `.env` file or your preferred secrets manager                    |

**Never commit secrets.** The `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `.env.local`, `.kestrel/`, and `docker-compose.override.yml`.
