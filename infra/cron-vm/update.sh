# infra/cron-vm/update.sh — Self-update the worker on the GCE VM.
#
# Phase 8 PR-16 — runs every 5 minutes via hamafx-update.timer. Compares
# the local checkout's HEAD to origin/main; if they differ:
#
#   1. Hard-reset to origin/main.
#   2. pnpm install --frozen-lockfile.
#   3. pnpm --filter @hamafx/worker build.
#   4. pnpm --filter @hamafx/worker test --run.
#
# Any of those four failing rolls back to the previous SHA, restores
# the previous install, and pings HC_UPDATE_UUID with `fail`. Only on a
# clean upgrade do we (a) write the new SHA to /opt/hamafx/.deployed-sha,
# (b) restart the worker, (c) ping HC_UPDATE_UUID with `success` and the
# new SHA in the body.
#
# Idempotent — re-running mid-flight is fine; the no-op fast-path is
# `git fetch && [HEAD == origin/main]`.
