// PF-01 — Query/repository layer barrel.
//
// All query helpers live here. Consumers import from this barrel instead
// of importing `schema` directly. This decouples high-level modules
// from Drizzle ORM internals and makes the data-access surface explicit.
//
// Namespace conventions:
//   queries.threads.getById(id, userId)  — single thread
//   queries.threads.list(userId)         — list threads
//   queries.alerts.create(input)         — create alert
